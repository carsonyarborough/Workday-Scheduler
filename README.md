# Workday-Scheduler
This challenge I worked with existing code to create a workday scheduler that helps you plan out the rest of your work day. 


## What I learned
I learned how to use if/else if statements to color coordinate the hours of the day based on the current time of day. I used html to add icons to the save buttons and code all the timeblocks. Moment.js is used to display the current time of day the webpage was opened at and refreshes when the page is.
